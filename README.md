#ResponsivePortfolio

For this assignment I created a live mobile responsive portfolio on Github. 
I created an index.html, contact.html, and portfolio.html as three separate pages that linked together. 
I created a navigation bar, grid system with containters, theme, resposive layout, picture layout place holders, cards, and jumbotron utilizng Bootstrap. I used stylesheets and javascript from Bootstrap and put them into my html files. 
I created responsive links that go to three sections: About me, Portofilo, and Contact. 
My Portfolio page has 3 of my projects with links to the deployed sites.
My website is mobile friendly.
