Welcome to my portfolio!
For this assignment I created a live mobile responsive portfolio on Github. I created an index.html, contact.html, and portfolio.html as three separate pages that linked together. I created a navigation bar, grid system with containters, theme, resposive layout, picture layout place holders, cards, and jumbotron utilizng Bootstrap. I used stylesheets and javascript from Bootstrap and put them into my html files. I created responsive links that go to three sections: About me, Portofilo, and Contact. I made surer my website would work on a smaller screen and my iphoneX by using the inspect tool on chrome. I made commits as I was updating and pushed them through the terminal. I had fun with this assingment and felt that I fully grasped the concept. I'm excited to update this portfolio throughout the course.
